This plugin provides a 'Bamboo Most Read Posts' widget, which works in exactly the same way as the built-in 'Recent Posts' widget, but displays your site's most read posts instead.

Usage

Once the plugin is activated it will begin tracking every visit to a post on your site. Add the 'Bamboo Most Read Posts' widget to your chosen sidebar to display a list of your site's most read posts.
